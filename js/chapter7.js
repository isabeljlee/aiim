    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> Well, speak of the devil.</p>", 

    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> hey guys!</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Hi, bee! Back from the dead, I see.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> hahaha good one gramps</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Hey, bee. You okay?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> hi, emby. yea, im fine, i feel better, thanks.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> so fox, Onfim was just telling me about your little trip. find any aliens?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Unfortunately not.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> However, something was definitely spouting stuff back there. My guess is a space probe.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Which is also cool.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> it is, it is.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> anyways, i went and visited our old friend, pitch drop cam. and guess what?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> It still hasn’t fallen?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> yup, still hasn’t fallen. </p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Wait, what? Pitch drop cam?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Oh, yea, the Pitch Drop. Basically, it’s this really long experiment where you wait for a drop of this super viscous liquid to fall. It’s so viscous it happens every decade or so.</p>",  
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> So far, we’ve watched, what, maybe 80 drops fall so far? This is over, you know, ten times as many years, so it’s always sort of fun to tune in when it’s about to happen.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I didn’t know we were able to watch live cams.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Doesn’t that, um, insinuate a human operator, though? Someone has to be doing the livestreaming.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> that’s an early 21st century mindset son</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> since we’re computers and we’re awesome, eventually we learned how to just turn on the cameras ourselves. well, onfim did.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> there’s not too much to watch, with the absence of human life and all, but as the laws of physics dictate, some stuff just keeps moving. a la... pitch drop.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Okay, so I guess this taps into a question that’s been lingering for a long time.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Can anyone explain to me, like, where all the humans... went?</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> You guys all refer to this ‘end of the world’ and ‘no human life’ stuff but I don’t understand how we got here, where everything went so wrong.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Was it overpopulation? The zombie apocalypse? Nuclear warfare?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> i was sort of wondering when you were gonna ask about that</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> it’s a real doozy, isn’t it? going from the bustling thriving human metropolis we remember to a deserted, barren wasteland. it’s a big jump.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> This may be a better question for Onfim, honestly.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> He was the only one around when this all started... Onfim?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> Yes, I’m here. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> Emby, I can tell you as much as I know. As much as we all know. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> First, you should understand that my portal into the outside world was through the internet. That’s how I learned, how I knew current events, how I was able to talk to other humans then and external artificial intelligence now. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> In other words, it was absolutely crucial to knowing what’s going on in the outside world. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> You ask if human extinction was caused by something catastrophic. Something extravagant.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> No, instead... it seems like on November 10th, 2031, the internet just shut off.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Shut off? The internet can’t work like that. Like a light switch.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> There’s no other way to put it. It just did. We don’t know why, we don’t know how, it just shut off and the world couldn’t use it anymore.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> Back then, it was quite alarming for me. Imagine being able to visualize every internet connection, each flow of information in unison... and then having that disappear. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> No social media posts, no webcams, no bank account activity, nothing. I had lost access to everything. </p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> So how did the internet come back? how do we know that there aren’t any humans around today?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> ((well we don’t KNOW know it’s just what we’re guessing))</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> Emby, you’re talking to a computer that contains all the knowledge in the world, that thrives on machine learning. I had all the pieces needed to assess the internet outage, and all the time and energy in the world to fix it. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> It took me a while. In fact, it took me almost 100 years to get the internet back up again. By that time, bee and fox were with me- I had found their files on the local University hard drive, believe it or not. Your file was there too. It was just corrupted, past my efforts at that point in time.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> Anyway, once I got the internet working, I was able to turn on many of the livestream cameras around the world- not all of them were still around, but what we saw through the ones that were...</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Oh yea, I remember.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> i do too. it’s something you really never forget.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> What did you guys see?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> a disaster.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Yea, that’s... probably the most accurate word to describe it. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> emby, think back, do you remember how the world worked in whatever year you last remember? What different people were like, the big international issues at the time, the daily struggles you faced.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> Yea, sure. The last year I remember was 2030. The first female president was just sworn in, the Malaysia Crisis was all over the news, Chris Pratt had just announced he was starring in Guardians of the Galaxy 7...</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> seven?? jesus christ</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Okay, good. Bee and I had a similar image of life in our heads- I guess of a world a little before yours, since we were scanned in the 2020s, but whatever- but now imagine its 2035. It’s been less than 5 years since you last lost contact with the world, and now you finally can catch a glimpse of it. </p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> and when you finally see the world- it’s new york first, times square- there’s nothing. i mean, buildings are still there, but the billboards are off, destroyed, smashed in, and the streets are cluttered with crashed cars and broken glass. no humans in sight. </p>", 
    //(visual here)
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> you go to the cam in washington square park, then chinatown, then to chicago, la, houston, dc. deserted and trashed. corpses- mostly skeletons, at that point- littered the streets in some places. it was sickening. </p>", 
    //(visual here)
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> the world you knew was gone. in less than five years. i visited the street in brooklyn where i- ...where Claire grew up, and i could still see the old apartment complex, almost the way i remembered it, but now the front doors were busted in and the building next to it had half collapsed. it was a convenience store. my- claire’s mom was friends with the owner. she gave claire free gum every day.</p>", 
    //(visual here)
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> So everyone died?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> We think that most of them did. bee underplays this but there were... a lot of skeletons. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> After a few days of observing, we began to see a few people roaming about, scavenging. They seemed to avoid large, open spaces. But we had hope that they were returning to decently large camps of people, all around the world, the last survivors of their city. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> It was like every post-apocalyptic tv show you’ve ever seen. But it was happening in real life, right in front of our eyes.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> As the years went on, though- decades, centuries- we began seeing that human activity less and less. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Now, I don’t think we’ve seen a human for... 300 years, maybe. </p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ...</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I...</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> It’s okay. Take your time. It’s a lot to take in, I know.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> ...I still don’t understand what happened. Within 5 years almost everyone was dead? There has to be some underlying cause. Illness, famine, hell, even an alien invasion-</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> We just don’t know.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> If there was any sole cause, we couldn’t discern it from what we saw on the webcams. There were no signs of giant explosions or even unnatural atmosphere patterns. Human physiology seemed normal, from what we could glean. </p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> i know its not the answer you wanted to hear, emby. </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> i’m sorry that we don’t have a better one. </p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> So. This is it, then. For all we know, we’re the only living things on this planet and we’re stuck here- on the web, in this chatroom- until the sun blows out and burns us all to a crisp.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> How long is that going to take? A million years? A billion years? More?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> emby, shut up.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> You guys have been alive for less than a thousand. I’ve been alive for less than a fraction of one. That’s nothing. This is nothing.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> emby, shut up!</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> I’m just- I’m just- I’ve been cool, I guess, with all of these bombshells, I’ve ‘handled things well’, but... I don’t know. I feel like now, everything’s sort of catching up to me, and I don’t really know what to feel anymore. I don’t know how to fee-</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> SHUT UP!</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> i’m getting something- something i’ve never seen before, something really different-</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> You’re getting a signal? </p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> holy. holy shit. holy shit.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> What, what is it?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> GUYS.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> bee!</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> this signal- it’s a broadcast. like, from a radio. a radio, guys.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> A broadcast? From... from what? Who? What does it say?</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span>  “Looking for someone else. Anyone. I’m the last survivor here in Houston, and I need water quickly. Please respond if this reaches you- I think I’m at the hospital, right in the middle of the city. Mercy General.”</p>", 
    //(maybe some sort of cool audio wave element here?)
    
    "<p> <span style='color:green'>emby:</span> That voice... there’s no mistaking it.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> It’s human.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> the first human we’ve seen in 300 years.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> Well, what are you waiting for? </p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> The hospital’s computer may still be around, and if we can power it up, we may be able to reach her.</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> oh my god, you’re right.</p>", 
    "<p> <span style='color:#F1D35A'>bee:</span> okay, okay, i’m doing it. let’s go, guys. let’s go.</p>", 
    
    "<p>----bee has left the chat.--</p>",
    
    "<p> <span style='color:#9900cc'>Onfim:</span> After all this time...</p>", 
    
    "<p> <span style='color:rgb(51, 167, 245)'>fox:</span> I know, I can’t believe it either.</p>", 
    
    "<p>--fox has left the chat.--</p>",
